# Candy
Candy brings video chat to dating. The days of catfishing are **OVER**. On every Friday and Saturday between 7PM-9PM Local Time, users
can get on and video chat with people of their interest. Each call only lasts 120 seconds. What can you do with that time? - **Candy is available for people of ages 18-22.**
